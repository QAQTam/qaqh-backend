//! Single source of truth for per-session tool modes.
//!
//! BUG-013 / REFACTOR-ROADMAP 刀6: the preset table used to live in
//! `qaqh-runtime::agent`, the daemon validation whitelist lived in `qaqh-runtime`,
//! the prompt special-case lived in `qaqh-config`, and every shell invented
//! its own `minimal:dsh` literal. Adding or changing a preset therefore
//! touched four crates.
//!
//! All names, tool sets, and model-facing projections now live here. The
//! runtime crates only consume this contract and never redefine it.
